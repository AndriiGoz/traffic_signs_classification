# traffic_signs_classification

The purpose of this project is to train an implementation of the LeNet-5 Convolutional Neural Network for the 
classification of traffic signs provided by the user. The model was trained and tested on about 40.000 real photos of 43 
types of german traffic signs. Data was taken from The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB): https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_dataset.html
